To prevent confusion:
    urllib.parse.quote(): escapes URL characters
    html.escape(): escapes HTML characters

##### TODO #####

### GENERAL
mark-all-as-read button
Format times into: sept 05 20:09 (5m ago)
password caching
close socket GUI button
account manager and settings page
settings DB table and load them into memory every startup
the sidebar highlighting for current pages can now be moved from javascript to server-side with janja


### BOXES
two equal-sized buttons on the right side of every entry in the box lists:mark read, delete (with confirmation alert) (AJAX)
better support for handling which email accounts show up where, so some can be used exclusively as a separate inbox,
CONT: and some can be hidden from the main inbox.

! only show root messages, i.e. messages that don't have any replies presently in the inbox.
! bold threads containing ANY unread messages, not just unread roots.


### THREAD
add style to the show-quoted check-box
Linkify hyper-links in the body
Improve CSS for thread pages
Add reply button, reply all, other buttons to threads
linking to a non-root email should link to the root of that thread and then jump to and highlight that nonroot email!

! highlight unread messages


### COMPOSE
Styling
highlight reply sender in To: list
request read receipt option
gnupg options
preview source option (new tab)
attach (drag drop as well)
quote thread option
cc bcc
submitting (post)
Add sent messages to outbox
Default sender, and extract the sender from the "To" field of the in-reply-to message.





### MISC
DB UNIQUE errors should make themselves known to the user
set max sizes of UI elements to prevent distortion; hide some elements (bars) when DOM becomes too small
password input from browser / better password handling (no getpass)
html-to-plaintext messages for those with no plain counterpart
send confirmation dialogue
spam header detection


##### UNSOLVED PROBLEMS #####
Will non-standard headers like thread-index be necessary to parse in order to represent threads?
Why do pages occasionally take longer to load? Note that the delay is before do_GET is even called.
