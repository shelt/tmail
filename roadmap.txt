##### NOTES #####
.decode() before displaying?
will nonstandard headers like thread-index be neccesary to parse in order to represent threads?


#### web ####
PAGES
THREADS: all messages which have not been replied to by another message.
INBOX: all in messages listed by order of date
OUTBOX: all out messages listed by order of date
Selecting a message will show a thread. If the message is a reply to another message,
that message will appear below it. If the message has been replied to by another message,
that message, links to that message will appear.
If the message has been replied to (i.e. it is the in-reply-to field of some other message(s)),
links to those messages will show above the main message in bar type links.
