This is an python-based SMTP/IMAP mail user agent.

I made this because I wanted a tolerable email client that ran off a USB stick and didn't have dozens of nonstandard libraries, a horrendus GUI, poor configuration support or mandatory GnuPG integration.

This client is:

* Lightweight: Only uses standard python libraries

* Platform-independent: Anywhere you can install python.

* SSL enabled

* In early development and not yet fully functional

### Potential security concerns
* Depending on your MTA (Mail transfer agent), your IP address can be included in your mail header.
