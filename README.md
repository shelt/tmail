# tmail

This is an python-based SMTP/IMAP mail client.

I made this because I wanted a sensible email client that ran off a USB stick and didn't have dozens of nonstandard libraries and a horrendus GUI.

**This client is:**

* Lightweight

* SSL enabled.

* Under development and not yet fully functional.

* Biased towards plaintext. If you want to write HTML emails, this is not the tool for you. Minimal HTML parsing will be implemented so you can recieve email from bad mail clients.
