# tmail

This is an python-based SMTP/IMAP mail client.

I made this because I wanted a tolerable email client that ran off a USB stick and didn't have dozens of nonstandard libraries and a horrendus GUI.

This client is:

* Lightweight: Only uses standard python libraries.

* Platform-independent: Anywhere you can install python.

* SSL enabled.

* Under development and not yet fully functional.

### Potential security concerns

* Depending on your MTA (Mail transfer agent), your IP address can be included in your mail header.
